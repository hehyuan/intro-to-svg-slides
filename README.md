This repository contains slides accompanying an internal lunch & learn session in Thoughtworks on Intro to SVG, that happened on 12 November 2021.

Slides are built with [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev), with the [Penguin](https://github.com/alvarosaburido/slidev-theme-penguin) theme which I have slightly modified.
